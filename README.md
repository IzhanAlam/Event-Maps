About:

About the website.

The goal of this website is to allow users who are signed in to create events. All events have a timer until they are removed. Users are able to click the location where they wish to place their event, alongside a title, and description. You are also able to choose an icon and timer based on the type of event.


You are also able to get the directions to each event by clicking on the event popup and dragging the marker.

Private Instances:

When you click on "Private Map", you will be redicrected to a URL linked with your account. In a private map, you will be able to share the map with other users. If they are signed in, they will be able to add features to the map. Comments are enabled to discuss the features.

Events are automatically deleted after 24 hours for private maps.

Why?
The site was created with the intention of finding events happening around your area. If you wanted to find some people to play basketball with, you are able to create an event and people would be able to come to you to join your basketball game. Another reason was to allow for optimization. Users would be able to make an event for things like a pothole. The city would be able to look at it, and perhaps fix it. There are infinite possibilities.

The goal of private instances was to allow you to find places with the people you know. Let's say you're planning a trip. You would be able to go to your private map and label all the places you want to visit. Your friends or family would be able to see this and comment whether or not it is a good idea. Or maybe your friends are trying to find you. You can create an event, and send the link to your friends. They will be able to get the directions to you effortlessly.
